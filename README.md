A simple package for Laravel to notify handled errors, exceptions and more.

**Note**: this package is still under development and currently its features are very limited.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require encodia/laravel-something-wrong
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-something-wrong-config"
```

## Usage

Note: the current version only supports **Bugsnag**.

This means that anything you notify will use Bugsnag under the hood to send
a notification.

### Where

Typically, you will inject `Encodia\SomethingWrong` in your service class constructor:

```php

use \Encodia\SomethingWrong;

class MyService {
    private SomethingWrong $somethingWrong;

    public function __construct(SomethingWrong $somethingWrong)
    {        
        $this->somethingWrong = $somethingWrong;
    }
    
    public function doSomething(): void
    {
        // ...
        $this->somethingWrong
            ->exception(
                new \Exception("This wasn't supposed to happen, so let's notify it!")
        );
        
        // ...        
    }
}

    
```

If you prefer, you can use its facade:

```php
use \Encodia\SomethingWrong\Facades\SomethingWrong;

// ...
SomethingWrong::exception(
    new \Exception("This wasn't supposed to happen, so let's notify it!")
);

```

### How

You can notify a simple exception, without any further details:

```php
SomethingWrong::exception(
    new \Exception("Something wrong happened!")
);

```

If you need to add any details, just pass an array as second argument:

```php
SomethingWrong::exception(
    new \Exception("Something wrong happened!"),
    [
        'foo' => 'bar',
        'path' => 'a/b/c',
        'user' => auth()->user,
    ],
);
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
